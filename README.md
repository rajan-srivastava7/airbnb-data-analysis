Data Analyzing of Airbnb Since 2008
Abstract:
Although networked hospitality businesses as Airbnb are a recent phenomenon, a rapid growth has made
them a serious competitor for the hospitality industry with important consequences for tourism and for
tourist destinations. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the nature of the phenomenon, its potential
further development in the next five years and the impact these developments will have on tourism, on
hotels and on city destinations.
Design/methodology/approach:
A literature study, combined with scenario workshops and a Delphi panel, were used to map current
trends and uncertainties. With this input, future scenarios were elaborated using the Global Business
Network (“scenario cross”) method.
Findings:
Network platforms such as Airbnb are often classified under something called the “Sharing Economy”, a
denomination that obscures their true nature. Airbnb is a challenging innovation to which traditional
hospitality will have to respond. Its impact has at the same time led to a call for regulatory policies. The
definition of these policies and the evolution of tourism are variables that determine future scenarios.
Attempts to ban the phenomenon mean a disincentive to innovation and protect oligopolistic markets;
more receptive policies may have the desired results if tourism grows moderately but in booming
destinations they may lead to a harmful commercialization.
Originality/value:
Until now, Airbnb has been described in conceptual studies about the so-called “Sharing economy”, or
more recently in empirical studies about isolated effects of holiday rentals. This paper contextualizes the
evolution of networked hospitality and seeks to synthesize the sum of its impacts, thus enabling
businesses and local governments to define positions and strategies.
Keywords:
Trends, Scenario planning, Hospitality, Sharing economy, Short stay, Tourist pressure.

Introduction:
Just a few years ago, the emergence of networked hospitality businesses was hardly a topic of academic
nor of commercial interest. With the largest networked accommodation service, Airbnb, now surpassing
the major hotel chains in number of beds offered and in market valuation, it is safe to say that many
realized the extent of this disruptive business model too late. In this paper we will analyse this
development in order to assess its impact in the years to come. We will first discuss the drivers of growth
of digital platforms which explain this disruption in the context of structural societal changes. Short-stay
holiday rental by private individuals and entrepreneurs, as opposed to professional and established hotel
businesses, is sometimes – incorrectly, in our view – categorized as part of something called the “sharing”
economy. Our analysis of networked business models aims to demystify that understanding. While the
initial web-driven initiatives in “social travel” revolved around the adventurous and altruistic motivations
of offering people a place to stay and sharing experiences, networked hospitality businesses turned the
“inviting strangers to your home” concept into a for-profit model. With the anecdotal origin of two recent
university graduates converting their home into an “Air Bed & Breakfast” by offering overnight stays on
air mattresses during a San Francisco conference in 2007 (Guttentag, 2013), Airbnb created a
commission-based web-platform for room sharers and travelers. A few years later, the offer on the
company’s website goes way beyond air mattresses and people’s spare rooms: with Manhattan lofts for
$1.000 a night, luxury houses in Paris for multiple times that amount or properties in Barcelona for groups
of up to 20 people – to name just a few examples – , Airbnb has become a competitor and a disruptor for
the traditional hospitality industry. The phenomenon of networked hospitality businesses includes several
other companies, such as HomeAway, Wide or HouseTrip. Airbnb is the market leader and best
documented case in peer-2-peer (P2P)-accommodation; this study analyses the company as a reflection on
the networked hospitality phenomenon in general. With hospitality and tourism experts we looked into the
past, current and future impact of Airbnb and similar initiatives. These insights were the basis for future
scenarios, in a conceptual exploration that in the first place must become part of the academic discussion
on the future and hospitality and tourism. At the same time, our scenarios can have strong practical
implications. We hope that they will contribute to constructive policy development for municipalities and
other governmental bodies, as well as to strategic answers in the professional hotel industry.
Structural changes in society:
The main drivers for societal change can be considered from four perspectives; technological innovation,
sociological, philosophical and an economic perspective.
Technological perspective:
The number, speed and adoption of technological innovations grow exponentially. These continuous
innovations follow the law of Moore – according to which processing power doubles every two years –
and have a considerable impact on the way we organize our society, our economy, our health care and
education. This influences almost all aspects of our lives: the way we communicate, the way we produce
energy and the way we distribute. We just only mention innovations in the field of 3D printing, robotics,
solar energy, nanotech, biotech, life sciences. The physical world becomes digitalized. According to
Rifkin (2014) we are in the middle of the third industrial revolution and we move into the time frame of

the Internet of Things. We have become familiar with the internet of communication. Now we are moving
to an internet of energy and one of distribution. Three platforms that are migrating at the same time to an
Internet of Things and towards a zero cost based society cause an enormous disruption.
Sociological perspective:
Brand and Rocchi (2011) describe the changing ideas around the concept of value. The ideas that have
captivated people’s mind-sets over the last 60 years have moved from an industrial economy with a focus
on product ownership, to an experience economy, to a knowledge economy with focus on
self-actualization towards a transformational economy with focus on a higher purpose and searching for
meaningful living. From the business perspective, the paradigms shift from mass production, to marketing
and branding, towards knowledge platforms and value networks. These processes cause a higher
awareness and engagement in our society: social innovation of our educational system, our health care,
well-being and transport systems (Green, 2007). On top of that, new communicative technologies enable a
total connectivity and enable P2P networks.
Philosophical perspective:
According to Cornelis (1988) the human being unfolds his hidden learning programme through the logic
of feeling. The human being nestles itself in three layers of stability. The first is the natural system: the
human being is protected and hidden from society. Second is the social regulatory system where rules and
norms dictate the prescribed behavior, the human being is obedient to the norm. Cornelis argues that the
third layer of stability is entering the phase of deep communicative self-direction. The human being
becomes creative and actively determines the course of his life (Boswijk, 2013).
Economic perspective:
Our economy dematerializes; an important shift is taking place in Western economies, with a switch from
agricultural and industrial production to services in which experiences and meaning are important. In
general terms dematerialization may also be said to refer to the relative reduction in the amount of
physical materials required in order to perform economic functions (Herman et al., 1990). There are three
areas in which dematerialization finds expression: digitalization, eco-efficiency and intangible aspects of
consumption. On the above the economy based on scarcity transforms into an economy of abundance and
ubiquity. We are moving from a time frame of possession to the age of access (Rifkin, 2000). The process
of fast digitalization is disrupting old business models harder then we realize. Apart and aside from the
Internet of Things there is an increasing power shift between consumers and suppliers and their networks.
This process makes it possible for some organizations to grow exponentially.
The rise of P2P value networks:
The rise of the concept of co-creation and co-created value through value networks was initially noted by
Allee (2003), Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2004). They are the first to mention the essential paradigm shift
between firm centric and client centric, postulating that the process of value creation finds place “inside”
the consumer (Ramaswamy and Gouillart, 2010). For the first time the customer becomes part of and he
starts to manage his own value chain. The economy is developing into a networked economy instead of

the traditional hierarchical structure. Traditional suppliers lose control of their markets if they do not take
a crucial position in the digitalized networks. According to Pralahad and Ramaswamy co-created
platforms need to fulfill the following four conditions; they need to ensure the DART principle; dialogue,
access, risk management and transparency. Partially through new communication technologies and the
internet everybody communicates with everybody and everything. Here the democratization of
communication takes place and the world breaks open (Ridder, 2011). Consumers become co-creators of
value and have the potential to become entrepreneurs by dealing with their assets like solar energy and
renting out their houses and apartments (Boswijk et al., 2015).
The rise of exponential organizations:
The dematerialization and digitalization of our society made it possible for organizations to reach far
beyond traditional markets. Exponential organizations grow ten times as fast as their market. They
function better, are faster and cheaper. Ismail et al. (2014) describe the success factors of these companies
as follows: they have a compelling higher purpose, they dare to experiment, they have smart interfaces,
they build on community and engagement, manage algorithms, have leveraged assets and empowered
autonomous workers. Airbnb, Uber, Etsy, Gitgap are examples of “exponential organizations”.
Typology of networks:
To clarify the different types of digitalized value platforms we postulate two dimensions; the first
horizontal dimension is the commons vs the private/commercial, the second dimension is open systems vs
controlled and closed systems (Figure 1). Through introducing these two dimensions we identify four
types of value networks (adapted from Kostakis and Bauwens, 2014; Bauwens, 2014): 
1. In the upper left quadrant we identify open and not for profit systems. Like Wikipedia, Linux. Here one speaks of
co-created P2P value. The public benefit is central. There is no other reward than the intrinsic value.

2. On the upper right quadrant we identify P2P social market places based on open systems and with a
fine tuned distributed market function.
3. On the left bottom we identify collectives that are characterized through a closed protected system and
for the common good. We call these collectives; an example is the Mondragón collective in the Basque
Country (Kasmir, 1996).
4. On the bottom right, we identify the network capitalists, they are based on hyperconnected and
distributed platforms with a commercial goal.
This classification provides the framework for our analysis of Airbnb as an exponential organization in
the networked economy. We need to emphasize the difference between P2P networks that empower
individual consumers (Bauwens, 2014) and the overall concept of “networked economy” where
connections may be used for mutual benefit but also with commercial intentions. We propose to obviate
the term sharing economy because it is a contradiction in termini’s and confuses the academic discourse.
Network economy vs “sharing economy”:
Parties like Airbnb and Uber position themselves as part of the sharing or collaborative economy. This
positioning finds support in authors as Botsman and Rogers (2011), Botsman (2015) and Gansky (2010),
where “sharing” is used as a diffuse concept describing contact and transactions between individual
consumers. Frenken et al. (2015) define the sharing economy as consumers granting each other temporary
access to underutilized physical assets (“idle capacity”), possibly for money. By parsing his definition into
three elements, Frenken et al. claim to distinguish the sharing economy from other economic forms: 1.
Sharing is about consumer-to-consumer platforms and not about renting or leasing a good from a
company (business-to-consumer). In the latter case we would speak of product service economy, where a
consumer gains access to a product whilst the service provider retains ownership.
2. Sharing is about consumers providing each other temporary access to a good, and not about the transfer
of ownership of the good. Thus, the sharing economy does not include the second-hand economy, in
which goods are sold or given away between consumers (as occurs on online platforms such as EBay or
Facebook).
3. Sharing is about more efficient use of physical assets and not about private individuals delivering each
other a service. After all, physical goods can go unused, but people cannot. Internet platforms that bring
consumers together to provide each other with services represent the on-demand economy. An example of
such a platform is Task Rabbit, through which you can hire people to carry out work around the house.
Also Rifkin (2014) uses the term “sharing economy” when referring to – what we would preferably call –
a hyper connected economy. While market places connect supply and demand between customers and
companies, digital platforms connect customers to whatever (Olma, 2014). The platform is a generic
“ecosystem” able to link potential customers to anything and anyone, from private individuals to
multinational corporations. Everyone can become a supplier of all sorts of products and services at the
click of a button. This is the real innovation that digitalization and digital platforms have brought us. The
concept of “sharing economy” should be distinguished from what is traditionally called “sharing”. The
essence of sharing is that it does not involve the exchange of money. Sharing only happens in the absence
of market transactions. What companies as Uber, Airbnb, Task Rabbit or Postmates have in common is

that they are platforms coordinating supply and demand of products and services that in their present form
were previously unavailable on the market. Uber is a platform where people looking for a cab quickly
find their non-, semi-, and real-professional taxi driver, thus enabling drivers to become entrepreneurial.
Airbnb allows people to sublet their houses, Task Rabbit connects supply and demand for chores,
Postmates for deliveries, Instacart for grocery shopping. While it might be convenient to make use of
these services, they have absolutely nothing to do with sharing. They stand for a digitally enabled
expansion of the market economy, which, again, is the opposite of sharing.
The case of Airbnb:
Airbnb started in 2008 as a simple proposition that combined economic benefits for travellers and for
residents of tourist areas. As Molly Turner (2013), Global Head of Civic Partnerships at Airbnb, explains:
“Our business model is based on people who can’t afford their homes and need extra money, so they rent
out their homes”. The company’s success can also be explained by the secondary effects of this basic
proposition:<br>

■a compelling experience value proposition: “Live like a local”;<br>
■ easy access and the establishment of a trusted marketplace, through engagement and community (P2P);<br>
■ the power of the network, leading to increasing scale advantages; and<br>
■ leveraged assets (Ismail et al., 2014; Boswijk et al., 2015).

So far, especially the experiential aspect – staying over at someone’s place, allowing for contact between
visitors and residents and for “off-the-beaten-track” tourism – has made it tempting to compare the
concept to actual “shared” activities, especially Couch surfing. This has led to the erroneous classification
or Airbnb, where private individuals exchange economic goods – tourist accommodation – and both pay a
business that has created an enabling platform, as “sharing”. The concepts and the economic effect of
Airbnb are radically different than the shared use of an asset as the exemplary power drill (Botsman,
2010/2015):
1. It can be discussed whether housing is an underutilized asset. In any case, in those instances where a
resident leaves his house to rent it, we see substitute use rather than additional use;
2. The demand for holiday rentals is far more elastic than for the typical power drill; and
3. Unlike underutilized power drills, the short-stay rental of private homes entered in direct competition
with an existing market.
The economic effect has made Airbnb disruptive for the traditional hotel industry. In the next sections we
will analyse the future impact of Airbnb on hotels, on tourism and on destinations.
Literature review
Business model
The spectacular growth of Airbnb and similar initiatives is still too recent to be thoroughly reflected in
academic literature. In general, the limited number of studies either study the phenomenon as a showcase
of the emergent “sharing economy”, or they analyse specific characteristics of the offer: its business
model and disruptive effects, consumer adoption and trust, positive and negative impact on city

destinations and regulation issues. To keep pace with its rapid and disruptive growth, it is necessary to
combine academic insights with trends and developments identified by industry reports, general news
media and trade journals. If we look at studies on Airbnb as part of the networked economy, two
explanations of its success are dominant: idealistic motives and, in particular, the authenticity of P2P
contact in the accommodation experience, on the one hand, and by economic benefits for hosts and
guests, on the other, Airbnb and other forms of P2P travel are categorized by Botsman and Rogers (2010)
as examples of the “Collaborative lifestyle” that combines the “benefits of ownership with reduced
personal burden and cost and also lower environmental impact”. The desire for social interaction is often
seen as the main driver behind the growth of the phenomenon (Gansky, 2010; Ikkala and Lampinen,
2015). For Rothkopf (2014) Twitter and Airbnb are ways of “connecting with others in ways that are both
creative and progressive”. Marriott CEO Arne Sorensen is quoted highlighting the “taste of the authentic
neighborhood life” as the reason for Airbnb’s success (Tuttle, 2015). Nevertheless, if we go from these
conceptual approaches that seek to explain and advocate the emergence of the collaborative economy, to
studies into the actual motives of participants in the phenomenon; idealism seems to play a secondary
role. For guests, Airbnb is primarily a low-cost option (Guttentag, 2013; Liang, 2015). Airbnb hosts are
also driven in the first place (IPSOS, 2013; Holte and Stene, 2014; Hamari et al., 2015) or to an important
degree (Glind, 2013; Stors and Kagermeier, 2015) by financial motives. This financial motivation does
not necessarily contradict the social or environmental advantages consumers may seek in sharing;
however, an important aspect to watch for the future of Airbnb is whether its economic effect will still be
that “people have to buy less goods while still having access to the services of those goods” (Glind, 2013,
p. 30). This economic aspect is in fact crucial for the business model of Airbnb. P2P rentals follow the
same business models as traditional B&Bs, except for the impact of the Airbnb community and the
promotional advantage of the worldwide platform. Compared to hotels, Airbnb hosts offer competitive
pricing because in the case of private residences fixed costs as rent and electricity are already covered,
because of minimal labour costs, the fact that Airbnb revenue is usually an additional income, and
because stays are usually not taxed. The business model of the platform itself is based on commissions
paid by guests (6-12 per cent) and hosts (3 per cent) (Guttentag, 2013). P2P accommodation can therefore
be seen as a two-sided market in which the platform facilitates transactions and adds value to both sides
by bringing both buyers and sellers “on board” (Rochet and Tirole, 2004). The price composition favors
or “subsidizes” the host side in the case or Airbnb, as part of the company’s growth strategy: sellers are
incentivized to join the network, thus maximizing its attractiveness to accommodation seekers. Unlike in
more traditional business models, in the case of two-sided platforms growth leads to increasing returns to
scale, as users will pay more for access to a bigger network (Eisenmann et al., 2006). It is therefore not
surprising that the platform, as it keeps adding listings to its offer (currently 1.5 million) shows a
continuous and explosive growth, with a forecasted number of 80 million nights booked in 2015
(Somerville, 2015). To make this business model work, Airbnb had to address three key issues: getting
hosts and guests on board, avoiding a direct negotiation and establish trust as a condition for transactions
to take place. As indicated by Guttentag (2013), the marketing power is what set Airbnb apart from the
traditional vacation rental market. The “sharing” philosophy and the image of a warm and authentic
community – as transmitted mainly in video testimonials – has been essential to persuade hosts and guests
to join the network (Stern, 2010; Yannopoulou et al., 2013). But at the same time, direct transactions
between the two parties had to be prevented as this would lead to a one-sided business (Rochet and Tirole,
2004). The company does this directly through an algorithm that blocks messages containing phone
numbers or e-mail addresses, as well as by offering services to facilitate transactions such as credit card

payment, pricing tools and insurance (Consigli et al., 2012; Hill, 2015). Trust is an important concern for
internet transactions in general and more so if the transaction entails admitting strangers to one’s private
environment. Obviously traditional hotels have a competitive advantage because they reduce risks
through standardization, safety regulations and business reputation. Airbnb “horror stories” are abundant
on the internet, as well as articles assessing the risks (Nicholls, 2015; Folger, 2015; Lehr, 2015). Kohda
and Masuda (2013) suggest that the value created by sharing services resides precisely in the absorption
of the risks of customers. Trust represents a value as “reputational capital” allows for higher prices (Ikkala
and Lampinen, 2014). The mutual review system of hosts and guests is seen as the foundation of trust in
Airbnb transactions (Finley, 2013; Guttentag, 2013; Lehr, 2015), even though precisely the reciprocity of
the system is considered to undermine its reliability (Slee, 2013; Zervas et al., 2015).
Impact:
Airbnb is expected to drive hotel rates and revenues down as the additional supply will affect the
distribution of power in the market (Consigli et al., 2012; Jordan, 2015). According to Merril Lynch, as of
2017 oversupply will negatively affect hotel business values (Huston, 2015). The impact of Airbnb on
hotel revenues has been quantified in a study by Zervas et al. (2014): the authors estimate a 13 per cent
loss of room revenue for Austin and a 0.35 per cent decrease in monthly hotel room revenue for every 10
per cent increase in Airbnb listings for Texas in general. The same authors observe that lower-end hotels
and hotels without business facilities suffer most. A study on the effect of Uber on taxis in New York and
Chicago shows, in a similar fashion, a reduction of complaints as the alternative offer grows, which can
be interpreted as a clean-up of the system: taxis are forced to improve quality or they are driven out of
business (Wallsten, 2015). It is a general understanding that Airbnb “is bad for hotels but good for
tourism”. The company asserts it is complementary to traditional hospitality since around 70 per cent of
their offer is outside central hotel districts (Airbnb, 2013a). Merril Lynch analysts, on the other hand,
consider that a considerable part (43-67 per cent) of Airbnb listings compete directly with the traditional
hotel offer as they are not shared spaces (Huston, 2015). Guttentag (2013) suggests that spending may in
fact suffer because of cheaper accommodation, while also the creation of additional income rather than
full-time jobs may hurt the hotel industry, a finding that was corroborated by a study in Spain (EY
España, 2015). A series of impact studies was commissioned by Airbnb itself. These contain estimates of
economic impact, varying from $56 million of generated economic activity for San Francisco in 2012
(Airbnb, 2012) to $1.15 billion for New York in 2014 (Airbnb, 2015); jobs generated – the latter
presumably derived from the first – a comparison of Airbnb and hotel guests spend, and host data such as
their economic background, monthly Airbnb earnings (around $600, or $130 per night rented) and the
percentage of hosts who share their primary residence (between 80 and 90 per cent). As for the guests, the
studies report an overwhelming majority aspiring to “live like a local”, and percentages between 27 and
35 of visitors reporting they would not have stayed if there was no Airbnb. Finally, the studies on Boston
and Los Angeles report important environmental effects (Airbnb, 2014b, c). The data provided by Airbnb
have not been corroborated by independent studies, and they are not fully homogeneous for the different
destinations. Except for the latest New York study – 760,000 visitors – tourism volumes are not reported,
which makes it hard to assess the impact estimates. Most data seem to be based on host and guest surveys
(Airbnb, 2013f). While on the one hand the accuracy of these answers can be questioned (e.g. amount of
earnings and spending), on the other hand some of the answers seem hardly relevant: if 93 per cent wants
to “live like a local” (Airbnb, 2013b), to what extent would such a question reflect customer behavior?
For the location of Airbnb listings – 96 per cent outside traditional hotel districts (Airbnb, 2014a) – a

definition of where these districts are would be essential. For the beneficial environmental effects, one
would expect a thorough explanation. The reports insist that the vast majority of Airbnb hosts are
non-commercial sharers of their primary residences. However, it can be discussed whether these
percentages reflect the nature of Airbnb operations; in this case the number of property listings rather than
the number of hosts would be relevant. This discrepancy was also identified in the report issued by the
New York State Attorney General (2014): “the remaining six percent of hosts dominated the platform
[...], offering up to hundreds of unique units, accepting 36 percent of private short-term bookings, and
receiving $168 million, 37 percent of all host revenue”. In other cities we probably have similar
concentrations: in Amsterdam “multilistings” are 24.8 per cent of the offer (Cox, 2015), while in
Barcelona 2.5 per cent of hosts control 30 per cent of entire apartment rentals and 60 per cent are offered
by users with more than one listing (Arias Sans, 2015). A study commissioned by the Spanish hotel
industry questions the panorama depicted by Airbnb and draws conclusions completely opposed to those
presented by the company. The Airbnb offer concentrates in tourist city centres more than traditional
accommodation (73 vs 42 per cent). This leads – at least, in a causal relation suggested by the report – to
housing price hikes that expels residents from tourist areas: for instance, in Barcelona’s Ciutat Vella the
average sales price increased 24.5 and 3.6 per cent of the resident population was lost. Rather than
attracting new segments, the P2P visitor has a similar profile as the traditional hotel guests; the choice is
mainly motivated by saving costs and only marginally by the experience. The economic effect is 84.4 per
cent lower, considering that the visitors spend €20.30 less on accommodation, €16.70 less on restaurants,
retail and entertainment and their indirect impact is €31.20 lower. The direct and indirect employment
effect of P2P travel is 9.8 jobs created per 100 beds, vs 53.3 jobs per 100 beds in traditional
accommodation (EY España, 2015). The growth of Airbnb is often linked to the protest movement against
tourist pressure in cities as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Berlin. The volume of Airbnb users does not
suggest a causal relation (Kagermeier et al., 2015), but the emergence of P2P travel and residents’
annoyance with tourism seem to be both rooted in increased mobility and low-cost travel (Hooper, 2015).
If in the social and cultural impact of tourism we distinguish increased availability to facilities –
infrastructure, retail, entertainment – on the positive side, and increased competition for the use of these
and previously existing facilities – e.g. parking space – on the negative, the frequent mention of Airbnb in
recent debates becomes understandable: P2P travel does not add amenities – instead, it explicitly claims
to intensify the use of existing local facilities – whereas commercial hosts – as opposed to those who
share their primary residences – compete with residents on the housing market (Quijones, 2015; Croft,
2015). This may lead to the displacement of residents and an increase in rental costs, as has been noted in
New York and San Francisco (New York State Attorney General, 2014; Zervas et al., 2014; Sabatini,
2015). These disadvantages may be amply compensated, as the Airbnb (2012, 2013b, c, d, e, 2014b,
2015) studies indicate, by the economic impact of tourist spend in non-tourist neighborhoods.
Nevertheless, a recent study in Berlin has shown that these effects in non-centric neighborhoods are
limited, especially for retail (Kalandides et al., 2015). If the impact is reduced to the indirect effect of
residents spending their additional income, the conclusion must therefore be that the main financial
beneficiaries are the Airbnb hosts themselves. This means that commercial hosting and gentrification
reduce the equal access of hosts to this market and eventually may sharpen socio-economic differences in
and between urban neighborhoods.

Scenarios:
The success of networked platforms as Airbnb is caused by a number of big and constant drivers as
technological advancements, socio-cultural change and globalization. These drivers will certainly
continue to fuel the phenomenon in the near future. Uncertain or variable drivers may, however, steer the
evolution of P2P travel in different directions. As identified in our literature study and industry debate, the
major unknown is the scope and effect of future regulations. At the moment two extremes – plus
in-between shades of grey – become manifest in different cities: while some seek to ban Airbnb and
short-term rentals altogether, other cities embrace the phenomenon and cautiously address tax and
security excesses. How Airbnb evolves will also depend on tourist demand: in highly popular destinations
the role and impact of holiday rentals will differ from cities with a more modest tourist economy. Even
though tourism growth cannot be considered an uncertainty at global level, this will cause variances at
local level. Both distinctions lead to four extreme scenarios. The intention of these is not predictive; they
depict plausible chains of cause and effect and allow for an evaluation and discussion of the advantages
and disadvantages of each situation (Table I). As a next step in the scenario process, these drivers are
worked into narratives that illustrate the most relevant drivers and uncertainties reducing their complexity
(Lindgren and Bandhold, 2009). These narratives must be meaningful, plausible, imaginative and novel
(Yeoman et al., 2012).
Conclusions and discussion:
Networked hospitality businesses have emerged in recent years and, although primarily driven by
economic benefits, they have brought disruptive innovations to the offer of tourist accommodation and to
how visitors experience their stay in a destination. These innovations became possible thanks to the
creation of network platforms, which enabled users to share underutilized goods, but which also can be
used for economic transactions. Airbnb is an example of a for-profit P2P network platform. Airbnb
competes with traditional hotels on price – and initially in particular hurt two and three-star hotels on the
leisure market – but it also had an experiential value that enthused many travellers: the surprise of a
diverse offer, contact with locals, being part of a community and staying in residential neighborhoods.
Meanwhile, the digitalization of the marketplace and the network or two-sided business model allowed
for an exponential and on-going growth. This growth threatens the market share of traditional
accommodations, puts pressure on housing markets and it contributes to tourist nuisance to residents,
although this effect may be exaggerated in popular perceptions. The appeal Airbnb has for a broad range
of travellers – including business travellers – spurs innovation in the hospitality sector. Experiential
elements of Airbnb are adopted in new hotel concepts:
1. customization and personalization: a shift from SOPs to personalized attention and guest experiences;
2. uniqueness of the offer: budget hotels emphasizing unusual design and high-quality F&B offer;
3. use of existing buildings: repurposed buildings, the original function of which becomes part of the
experience;
4. community building between guests and with locals; social innovation: F&B outlets or events aimed at
visitors and residents; and
5. integration into local economies: connection with neighborhood businesses and employment or
trainings in less privileged areas. In the future we may see further emulations such as branded apartment

rentals, as well as the use of Airbnb as an additional sales channel. Further study is required to see
whether such innovations – concepts as BeMate, Yays or Zoku – will succeed in regaining Airbnb market
share by combining the appeal of local experiences with the advantages of professional hospitality. At the
same time, the evolution of networked hospitality companies will have to be monitored; in particular, the
success of these companies on the business market, as an important early warning for a further erosion of
traditional hotel brands. Further disruptions may derive from their potential to invest in cross-overs such
as Online Travel Agents or in any other element of the guest journey. The platform has grown explosively
amidst a regulation void, a situation local governments are seeking to address. Key issues governments
and city destinations will face are: 1. Taxation: can unregistered Airbnb visitors be taxed just as registered
hotel guests? Can Airbnb income be established and taxed? 2. Visitor streams: while Airbnb is not the
cause of increasing visitor numbers, it creates an additional complication. How can cities measure the
amount of visitors in order to manage tourist streams? 3. Information ownership: the fact that Airbnb does
not disclose visitor and host information, gives the company leverage in negotiating regulation issues with
cities. 4. Safety: traditional hospitality companies are subject to regulations to ensure the safety of guests,
employees and residents. How can these be enforced for Airbnb properties? 5. Consumer protection:
besides safety concerns, are consumers entitled to the same kind of protection in transactions with private
hosts as with commercial organizations?
